# Sheba EHR – AI-powered Health Record System for Africa

Sheba is an open-source, AI-powered electronic health record (EHR) platform designed for African communities. Our mission is to improve early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment outcomes by building a local, data-informed system for frontline health workers.

## Vision

- Help healthcare workers diagnose and prevent diseases early using AI trained on African data.
- Build interoperable, decentralized records that follow the patient across clinics and hospitals.
- Support patient consent and genomic data collection to inform inclusive drug development.
- Create the foundation for Africa’s largest health-biobank to unlock breakthroughs in public health.

## Status

We are in the early research and development phase. This repository will be updated regularly as we build out the MVP and begin testing with partners in Kenya and Ethiopia.

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- AI & Machine Learning (for clinical insights and pattern recognition)
- Interoperable Health Data Standards (e.g. HL7 FHIR)
- Secure, consent-based patient data handling
- Future support for genomic data layers

## Get Involved

We welcome developers, healthcare workers, researchers, and funders to collaborate with us. If you’d like to contribute, reach out!

## License

This project will use an open-source license (MIT or similar) to ensure free access and collaboration.
